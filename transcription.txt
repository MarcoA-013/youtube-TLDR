  I'm karembachini and today we're going to do a makeup very inspired by the makeups that I'm seeing here in the makeups that Japanese women use now the tones of Japan and we're also going to test the new beyong foundation that has so it's makeup with skin care and there's an efficacy test and when there's an efficacy test you know it's been proven to work so yes there I liked it we're going to test it and see if the foundation is all that they're promising I'm going to  give you an opinion and we are going to do this very natural makeup that is now in fashion, right because in the old days we used to, last month we are going to do a makeup with a lot of plaster I keep doing it, a lot of people keep doing it is a lot of style but  so we talk about trends in makeup, which is what people are doing to where the market is heading, which is a more Glow well-groomed skin and not that overloaded makeup, for example, here, people do makeup so as not to look like that they're wearing makeup so they apply a super foundation nothing corrects dots like that with micro drops of concealer you know so they do this footprint but I'm not using anything so we're going to try to do it and I need to thank beyong For believing in our work and sponsoring this video so claps  for me yang and let's go to our video biang already had primers but they did an update first they changed the packaging now it's a Pump packaging before it was the dropper packaging which was a good packaging but this Pump is much more practical, right but  they didn't lose this thing with the glass which I think makes the pot very beautiful you know so beautiful beautiful Then they have this Pump packaging and it has two types of primer now the Primer has improved yes now it has actives that take care of yours  skin that is effective as an antioxidant and also controls oiliness helping the pores here And we also have seaweed extract that gives the skin firmness and also helps in increasing collagen, right in the production of collagen in the skin Which is very good  and then it comes in the version that is matte, you know, which type has no shine so it makes the skin drier and more noticeable and there is even a glossy version and this glossy version here has four colors so you can choose the one you like the most.
    what's the difference Man, I don't know how to choose So this one here will make your skin a little thicker because you're going to make a layer of a product with shine under your foundation and then how are we going to make the skin here younger? I'm using nothing and the shine will show through so your foundation will be more shiny here so you know when you turn your face it's windy and super hydrated and this one here will also bring hydration but it won't have that pearly effect so it won't add  so much shine like that in your foundation so what would I say to you if you want a brighter skin hit this one if you want more glowing skin this one I don't know which one I want to use well I'm going to use this one just because it's for  see the effect of the foundation as it would be without adding more shine to it because I already tested a little piece of the foundation and I know that it is very like that hydrated skin is very incare so I don't want to add more shine for you to have an idea of \\u200b\\u200bthe shine So let's go this one is the Young Studio primer And then I was afraid to be my friend seaweed extract so it does everything I told you and they have a Clinical test so the clinical test is a test here with several people who are using these products constantly every day and then for 28 consecutive days, so she used this product for 28 days people both products for 28 days and had these impressions And then people in the test noticed an immediate lift effect immediate reduction In the appearance of the pores that stays alone  the makeup lasted The makeup right the duration of the makeup how pretty it looks also that it helps to apply the foundation right because then it glides on more it's delicious that it's comfortable that even the one that has shine has a dry touch after application anyway very good  I 'm going to apply this here, wow, I spent a lot of time but I wanted to show it, it's slipping, it has this serum texture, right? moments later important look at the difference between them Both are Our serum texture right but you can see that this one here look it has more shine right A few particles of shine and it will make your skin more shiny more like this shiny hydration and nails look the Primer has dried  You can see that it has this effect of hydrated skin but the skin is dry, you see, it 's not sticky, it's dry but very hydrated and it really has a tightening effect that seems to do like this, look here, your skin is really firm.
      I can participate in this clinical study and say that it really works and then biangue launched a foundation they already had a foundation that was a heavier coverage and now they have the color Hydra Hair which is this one here it comes in a very simple tube I loved it beautiful and one  thing I love is the spout because the spout is embedded in the base So how does this work the spout and base are ready And then the product goes in here and then lacquered what does that mean your spout won't go  flying around because this is the best kind of little tube, you have the product here, you can dose it and the nozzle will not go out walking, you know those nozzles that sometimes don't want to stay in the base and then it keeps dropping all the time so  this foundation here doesn't have it this spout won't be coming off it wo n't be going anywhere this foundation is also a foundation that has a lot of clinical studies and proof of effectiveness it's a liquid foundation and when you apply it it gives you medium coverage but you  manages to build high coverage in some places if you want it it has d-panthenol which guarantees hydration and the duration of hydration throughout the day and it also promises to leave your skin in 40 minutes 70% more hydrated and this hydration it continues until  the next day so you use foundation today and tomorrow you will be feeling your skin 70% more deleted and this was proven with Clinical Taste so I came to do a test here in a very clear light which is a test try your foundation there on the site  da beyong There are several things like that for you to discover your skin tone So there is one Ah, you can choose which tones are similar to you in Discover your Tone and there is also an application called Try your foundation and that is what we are going to test  here now good first I'm going to click on the tool that has a thing like this look that is to divide our face the Tom that I think will be mine is the 15 n that gave it was the Tom that gave when I did Discover your Tom  there on the site, I'm going to press here on 15 n and I thought it was very good, here's a little more that you can put on more coverage or less coverage And then you can try other shades of foundation, look, you see, I'm changing it, there's one here that  it looks great on my face but my friends' neck didn't roll So I think this cool tone here is very good for my neck and then you can take it out of the fish mode from the split mode, right, and put the whole foundation on your face and see  if that's what you want the 21 n was also very good but I still go for the 15c because I know myself and then yes So there's this technology that they made not only to help you not make a mistake it's to help you get it right and the  make sure what you're buying so you don't waste a foundation you have to return the product, it won't be good for you and it's a very good tool for those who don't know how to choose the shade of foundation because then you 'll choose right and you'll see  so I do n't want this one because it hits the neck no I want this one because it hits the face so very tanned I'm going to choose a darker one so then you can see for sure if it's the one you want if it's your tone this tool calls color right  and it's a technology developed with an artificial intelligence that tries to adapt to skin tones.
       oh because here is the problem because I can go down to the base here but until here I have to shower to be able to apply makeup, right? There's also Nina, which is an antioxidant, it also helps with the pores, curiosity and she has an active called coenzyme  q10 which is an antioxidant and helps to improve firmness and stimulate collagen production So come on, I have a little sponge here that is from Biang, also beautiful, wonderful, with perfect points, perfect texture, everything perfect, and I'll tell you what I think is necessary  Maybe a little more, right, but let's start with a little bit and then we 'll see the color I'm using is 15 c and they have a lot of colors to go from the lightest skin to the Darkest There are a lot of colors, even you say that the foundation  it's vegan free of ingredients that are harmful to your skin for the environment This is very good beauty Clean and Wow, this amount that I applied I thought it was very good because it covered the whole skin it's very beautiful and I thought I only applied a little  foundation because I usually apply a lot more it really leaves a very hydrated effect here on the side I don't know if you can see it on the camera because I don't have my giant monitor but I can see that she has super natural skin and I wouldn't say that I  I'm using foundation, you know, it's like a finish and a feeling like the texture that I like and I don't feel that my skin has makeup on. 
       it turned out good I'm going to use a little more of it just here in the center of the face so we can build the layer here [Music] but wow Your bye from very close I felt that my pores They are really reduced my skin is well hydrated and I  I do n't think it looks like I'm using foundation [Music] very good and then she has this hydrated skin face but it's dry to the touch she looks really pretty and then we have the concealer a concealer that also has proven skin treatment effectiveness  and so its actives I thought they were very well chosen it has hyaluronic acid for hydration, right? it has caffeine that helps to alleviate dark circles that are due to poor circulation for example Mine are due to poor circulation so when I feel that when I use products containing caffeine it improves it gives a lightening and also has an active called hdt that  it helps with firmness elasticity so it helps with all aspects of dark circles, right Like firmness, right in the case of bags like this, it works on dark circles with this hdt when dark circles dark It has caffeine, it also has ceramide which is good because then you won't  having dark circles that are accumulating and it also does not crack because of the hyaluronic acid and it has a Flex color 360 technology which are super flexible treated pigments that adapt to the constant movements of the face that is very cool and It offers 24 hours of hydration and corrected skin  um it foams easily and then in the Clinical test there after 28 days people noticed that there was a 73% improvement in the lightening of dark circles 75% reduction in bags immediate hydration prolonged and lasting prolonged lasting just the same thing right it is immediate hydration and  long-lasting in the antioxidant region they protect up to 76% against free radicals and the improvement in Firmness so come on right I'm going to use the 2 7 C which I think will be a color that will be very good for me It looks like it doesn't need much either  today I'm using a little I'm saving on makeup guys because this thing is covering it without applying too much [Music] and I like this color a little darker to help with dark circles and I'm going to apply the 12 n which is a slightly lighter color here  that you know I like to light this part here bring it further forward there it looks beautiful in the picture [Music] Oh it turned out really nice close people [Music] very good very good so let's continue our Saga of makeup not too heavy  I'm going to try I'm going to use a blush from the brand because it's a liquid blush [Music] I don't know what's going to happen it stayed exactly where I applied Wow it's very basic you know I like a slipper but today it's going to be controlled Oh, I just applied a little pink like wow, it's really very natural, until I saw a lot, I'm going to apply a little concealer here.
